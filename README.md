## What is this?
A running list of simple ways to be better at using your browser.

## Tips
* **Listen to any article or blog post**
  * On iOS, go to Settings >  Accessibility > Spoken Content and turn on Speak Selection & Speak Screen. Now you can highlight any text to be read aloud or simply swipe down with two fingers to hear everything on a given screen. Unsure what the equivalent is for Android but I'd imagine they have one.
  * Google also recently released a new feature for their app on iOS, [the Google app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google/id284815942), which lets you do the same thing. It also allows you create a queue of content: https://twitter.com/Google/status/1306269254203867136?s=20.

* **Bypass Medium paywalls**
  * Go [here](https://github.com/manojVivek/medium-unlimited) and follow the instructions to download a browser extension that lets you read unlimited Medium articles, for free.

* **Bypass (almost) all paywalls**
  * Go [here](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome) to download an extension that lets you read paywalled articles from most news outlets, for free.

* **Toggle speed on any video**
    * Go [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en) to download an extension that lets you speed up or slow down videos without control settings.

* **Use the keyboard**
  * You've probably spent, and will spend, thousands of hours using a computer. If not already, it's worth investing 10 minutes to learn the keyboard shortcuts for common commands in Chrome, Gmail, or other things you use daily. [Use The Keyboard](https://usethekeyboard.com/) is a great resource for this -- Mac and PC users alike.
